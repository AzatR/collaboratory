# collaboratory
Laboratory for collaborative filtering

This project contain an advanced R implementation of collaborative filtering. It improves classic implementation, thus making it:
1. applicable on large-scale datasets (by calculating predictions partially on matrix chunks) and 
2. reducing the training time (mostly by using optimized calculations of similarities and k nearest neighbours).

It covers:
1. user-based collaborative filtering
2. item-based collaborative filtering
